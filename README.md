# explore_beziers

Some Python utilies to visualize/interact with Beziers curves and alogrithms
running on them

`explore_beziers` is an executable Python script, so steup a virtual env and then
`./explore_beziers`

Right now it is super dirty, there are no CLI options, you comment out at the bottom of the file the stuff you don't want to run
